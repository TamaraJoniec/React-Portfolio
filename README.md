# React-Portfolio

For this challenge, I will utilize what I have learned in `Module 13: React` to develop the initial scaffolding of my portfolio sites.

Now that I've worked with React and have multiple projects to share, it's time to develop the initial scaffolding for my first portfolio site as well as create and/or update other materials so that I can showcase my skills to potential employers. Creating a portfolio using React will help set me apart from other developers whose portfolios do not use some of the latest technologies.

### Design

* Mobile-first design

* Choose a color palette for my site so it doesn't just look like
the default bootstrap theme or an unstyled HTML site.

* Make sure the font size is large enough to read and that the colors don't cause eye strain.

### Base Requirements

* Technologies that must be used:
  * [ ] React
  * [ ] Navigation with `React Router`, dynamic rendering, or another thmyd part router
* my portfolio **must contain** the following information:
  * [ ] my name
  * [ ] Links to my:
    * [ ] GitHub Profile
    * [ ] LinkedIn Page
    * [ ] Email Address
    * [ ] Phone Number - (optional)
    * [ ] PDF version of my resume
      * My resume **must** contain up-to-date projects and professional experience
    * [ ] A list of projects (Challenges or Projects). For each project, make sure I have the following:
      * [ ] Project title
      * [ ] Link to the deployed version
      * [ ] Link to the GitHub repository
      * [ ] GIF or screenshot of the deployed application

### Requmyed Components

* At a minimum, my portfolio must render these 6 components:
  1. [ ] App
  2. [ ] Header
  4. [ ] Home
  5. [ ] Project Gallery

   * [ ] Must utilize router props to properly render the right project based on user selection
